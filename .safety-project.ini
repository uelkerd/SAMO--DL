# Safety Project Configuration
# This file pre-configures Safety CLI to prevent interactive prompts in CI environments

[project]
# Project name - prevents the "Enter a name for this codebase" prompt
name = samo-dl

# Project ID - optional but helps with consistency
id = samo-dl-project

# Organization - optional
organization = SAMO

[scan]
# Skip interactive prompts
interactive = false

# Note: targets and continue_on_error are now specified via CLI flags
# This allows more flexibility in different environments

# [policy]
# Policy file disabled - using command-line options instead
# policy_file = .safety-policy.yml

[output]
# Output format for CI
format = screen
# Detailed output for debugging
detailed = true
