# Ruff Linter Implementation Summary

## ✅ Successfully Implemented (January 22, 2025)

### Configuration
- **File**: `pyproject.toml` with comprehensive ML/Data Science rules
- **Version**: Ruff 0.12.0 installed in `samo-dl` conda environment
- **Script**: `./scripts/lint.sh` with 5 commands for easy usage
- **Documentation**: Complete guide in `docs/ruff-linter-guide.md`

### Results
- **Started with**: 550+ code quality issues
- **Auto-fixed**: 157 issues (whitespace, docstrings, exceptions)
