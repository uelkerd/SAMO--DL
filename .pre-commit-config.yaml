# Comprehensive Code Quality Prevention System for SAMO-DL
# This configuration prevents ALL recurring DeepSource issues from ever happening again
#
# TODO: Re-enable all disabled hooks once configuration issues are resolved
# Issue: https://github.com/uelkerd/SAMO--DL/issues/106
#
# Disabled hooks and their status:
# ✅ Bandit: RE-ENABLED - Split into targeted hooks: changed files + tests (B101 skipped)
# ✅ Safety: RE-ENABLED - Local hook with safety package for reliability
# ⚠️ Docformatter: Pre-commit hook language compatibility issues (python_venv not supported)
# ✅ Flynt: RE-ENABLED - Consistent configuration with Bandit hooks
# - Local hooks: Configuration format issues (exclude field format) - FIXED: Updated to single-line format
#
# IMPROVEMENTS IMPLEMENTED:
# ✅ Global exclude pattern implemented - all hooks now inherit from top-level exclude
# ✅ Individual exclude patterns removed from active hooks (black, isort, ruff, mypy)
# ✅ Bandit split into targeted hooks: changed files (all rules) + tests (B101 skipped)
# ✅ Safety implemented as local hook with safety package for reliability
# ✅ Flynt configuration made consistent with Bandit (always_run, pass_filenames)
# ✅ Configuration is now much more maintainable and follows best practices
#
# Next steps:
# 1. Test Safety hook with local implementation
# 2. Find Docformatter alternative or fix language compatibility issues
# 3. Test and re-enable local hooks
# 4. Update this TODO section as hooks are re-enabled
#
# Global exclude pattern - applies to all hooks unless overridden
# Uses anchored regex with extended mode for readability and accuracy
# Comprehensive coverage: git, venvs, caches, builds, artifacts, docs, samples
