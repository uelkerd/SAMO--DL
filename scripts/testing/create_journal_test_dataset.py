Create Journal Entry Test Dataset for Domain Adaptation

This script generates a realistic test dataset of journal entries for domain adaptation
testing as required by REQ-DL-012. The dataset will be used to validate that our
emotion detection model performs well on journal-style text (personal, reflective,
longer-form) rather than just Reddit comments.

Target: 100+ journal entries with realistic emotional content
Success Metric: 70% F1 score on this test set
