**FORBIDDEN:** Core ML functionality, API endpoints, data processing
**FILES TOUCHED:** 8 files
**TIME ESTIMATE:** 2 hours

## Changes

### ðŸ”’ Security & Infrastructure Improvements
- **GitHub Actions Security**: Added explicit permissions to `.github/workflows/pr-scope-check.yml` to prevent security vulnerabilities (CodeQL fix)
- **Console Script Fixes**: Corrected console script entry points in `pyproject.toml` for proper src-layout package structure
- **Training Module Structure**: Added missing `__init__.py` to `src/training/` for proper Python package imports

### ðŸ§¹ Code Quality Enhancements
- **Ruff Linter Integration**: Added Ruff alongside Flake8 in pre-commit configuration for faster, more comprehensive linting
- **Subprocess Security**: Fixed command injection vulnerability in `src/training/cli.py` with proper path validation
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused imports (typing.Union) via automated Ruff fixes

### ðŸ”§ Configuration Updates
- **Pre-commit Config**: Enhanced `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with both Ruff (--fix, --exit-non-zero-on-fix) and Flake8 for optimal code quality
- **Package Structure**: Ensured all console scripts (`samo-train`, `samo-api`) work correctly with src-layout packaging

## Testing
- âœ… All pre-commit hooks pass with new Ruff + Flake8 configuration
- âœ… Console scripts install and run correctly
- âœ… Security vulnerabilities resolved (subprocess injection, workflow permissions)
- âœ… Package imports work properly with updated structure

## Impact
- **Security**: Eliminated CodeQL security alerts and potential command injection vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Faster linting with Ruff (comprehensive rule coverage + speed)
- **Maintainability**: Better code quality with automated fixes and dual linting
- **Developer Experience**: Working console scripts and proper package structure
