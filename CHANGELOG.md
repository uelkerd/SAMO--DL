All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-07

### Added
- HF emotion model integration as default local provider with env toggles (`EMOTION_LOCAL_ONLY` default on, `EMOTION_MODEL_DIR` default `${EMOTION_MODEL_DIR:-/models/emotion-english-distilroberta-base}` from centralized constants).
- New endpoints in `deployment/secure_api_server.py`:
  - `POST /nlp/emotion` (single text)
  - `POST /nlp/emotion/batch` (batch texts)
- Maintenance script `scripts/ensure_local_emotion_model.py` to auto-download and materialize the model locally; logs to `.logs/model_download.log`.

### Dependencies
- Add `huggingface_hub==0.25.2` to `dependencies/requirements-api.txt` for snapshot downloads.
