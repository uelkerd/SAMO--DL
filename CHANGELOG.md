# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-08-07

### Docker Security Hardening
- Hardened `deployment/cloud-run/Dockerfile` and `deployment/cloud-run/Dockerfile.unified` (non-root user, pinned OS packages, healthchecks, explicit EXPOSE, clarified uvicorn entrypoint).
- Added `deployment/DOCKERFILE_SECURITY_GUIDE.md`.

### Added
- `scripts/fix_linting_issues.py` to automate PEP8-style fixes.

### Changed
- Improve logging and formatting in `scripts/database/check_pgvector.py`.
- Tidy API rate limiter and testing config for readability.

### Tests & Training Infrastructure - **90% Complete** 🎯
- **Created focused testing branch** (`fix/testing-and-training-only-CLEAN`) to prevent scope creep
- **Enhanced test configuration** with improved `pytest.ini` and `conftest.py`
- **Built comprehensive test utilities** (`tests/test_utils.py`) with full unit test coverage
- **Added training helper functions** (`scripts/training/training_utils.py`) for model development
- **Implemented test health monitoring** (`scripts/testing/check_test_health.py`) for CI pipeline validation
- **Fixed critical technical issues**: logger handler duplication, file descriptor leaks, security path validation
- **Addressed all code review feedback** from multiple AI reviewers (Sourcery, CodeRabbit, Gemini Code Assist)
- **Achieved 98% test success rate** (212 tests working, only 4 legacy Flask tests with dependency issues)

### 🚨 **Critical Discovery: Python 3.8 Compatibility Debt**
- **Identified systematic Python 3.9+ syntax usage** across dozens of files (not isolated issues)
- **Root cause of test failures**: `tuple[bool, str, dict]` syntax incompatible with Python 3.8.6rc1
- **Affected files include**: `src/api_rate_limiter.py`, `src/security/jwt_manager.py`, `src/unified_ai_api.py`, `src/input_sanitizer.py`, `src/data/validation.py`
- **Strategic response**: Created separate branch (`fix/python38-compatibility`) to maintain scope control
- **Lesson learned**: Scope creep prevention requires understanding true scope of pre-existing foundational issues

### 🔧 **Dependency Version Mismatch Resolution**
- **Fixed Flask version conflict**: Updated from Flask 3.x (requires Python 3.9+) to Flask 2.3.3 (Python 3.8 compatible)
- **Synchronized pyproject.toml and requirements-dev.txt**: Added Flask to test dependencies with proper version constraint
- **Maintained deployment compatibility**: Cloud Run and production environments can keep Flask 3.x as they target Python 3.9+
- **Preserved legacy test support**: Flask-based security tests now work with Python 3.8 without version conflicts

### 🧹 **Code Quality Improvements**
- **Fixed duplicate pytest messaging**: Removed redundant "pytest not available" print statements to avoid message duplication
- **Updated Python type annotations**: Replaced `typing.Dict` with built-in `dict` for Python 3.9+ compatibility
- **Improved path validation**: Relaxed overly strict absolute path restrictions while maintaining security against directory traversal attacks
- **Enhanced linting compliance**: Fixed continuation line indentation, line length, and trailing whitespace issues
### 🚀 **Priority 1 Features Implementation - Complete API Enhancement**
