# SAMO-DL Commit Message Template
#
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
#
# Types:
#   feat:     A new feature
#   fix:      A bug fix
#   chore:    Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools/libraries
#   refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
#   docs:     Documentation only changes
#   test:     Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
#
# Rules:
#   - ONE purpose per commit (no "and", "also", "plus")
#   - Subject line < 50 characters
#   - Use imperative mood ("Add" not "Added")
#   - No period at end of subject line
#
# Examples:
#   feat: add user authentication system
