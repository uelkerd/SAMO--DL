# SAMO Deep Learning Project Summary

## Current Status & Achievements

The SAMO Deep Learning project has successfully completed Weeks 1-4 (100%) of its development roadmap, focusing on BERT-based emotion detection model optimization. We've implemented temperature scaling and threshold calibration to address initial low F1 scores (7-8%), achieving significant improvements. Advanced optimization techniques have been added including model compression via dynamic quantization (reducing model size by ~75%), ONNX conversion for deployment flexibility, and F1 score improvement techniques (Focal Loss, data augmentation, and ensemble prediction). All CI pipeline issues have been resolved, particularly the BERT model initialization compatibility problem in test scripts that required updating the initialization pattern to match the current implementation (removing device parameter from constructor and moving model/tensors to device after initialization).

## Documentation & Infrastructure

We've created comprehensive documentation covering various aspects of the project: API Specification with detailed request/response schemas and authentication flows; Code Standards establishing naming conventions and organization patterns; Experimentation Log capturing model development insights; Deployment Guide with Docker/Kubernetes configurations; Monitoring Playbook defining metrics and alerting rules; and Testing Strategy outlining unit, integration, and performance testing approaches. The infrastructure now supports proper model calibration, compression, and deployment, with CircleCI integration for automated testing and validation. Key success metrics show improvements in F1 scores, response latency (~300ms), and model size (<100MB), though we're still working toward the target 80% F1 score.

## Challenges & Next Steps

The main challenges encountered were related to model initialization compatibility issues in CI tests, which stemmed from interface changes in the `BERTEmotionClassifier` that weren't propagated to all test scripts. Root cause analysis revealed that the constructor no longer accepted a `device` parameter, requiring updates to move models and tensors to the appropriate device after initialization. For future development (Weeks 5-6), priorities include production deployment preparation, further F1 score improvements, and implementing advanced features outlined in the roadmap. To avoid similar issues, we should implement stricter interface change management, ensure comprehensive test coverage for model initialization patterns, and maintain clear documentation of model API changes. The project is well-positioned to move into the production phase with robust monitoring, deployment, and testing strategies in place.
