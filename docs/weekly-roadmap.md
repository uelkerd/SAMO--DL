# SAMO AI/ML Implementation Roadmap: 10-Week Technical Strategy

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive technical roadmap provides a detailed implementation strategy for SAMO's AI-powered journaling components over a 10-week timeline. The strategy prioritizes **ModernBERT for emotion detection**, **BART for summarization**, **OpenAI Whisper for voice processing**, and **FastAPI for model serving**, while addressing privacy, performance, and deployment considerations essential for production-ready emotional AI applications.

## Core Technical Architecture

### Primary Model Stack Recommendations

**Emotion Detection**: **ModernBERT-base** fine-tuned on GoEmotions dataset delivers 99.3% F1 score with 2-4x faster processing than traditional BERT. For resource-constrained environments, **DistilBERT with quantization** provides 97% performance retention at 40% model size.

**Text Summarization**: **BART-large** excels at conversational journal summarization, maintaining natural tone and emotional context better than T5. Research shows BART produces more coherent, contextually aware summaries for personal narrative content.

**Voice Processing**: **OpenAI Whisper** achieves 8.06% Word Error Rate (best in class) with transparent pricing at $0.006/minute. Superior accuracy in noisy environments makes it ideal for natural conversation input.

**Model Serving**: **FastAPI** with ASGI architecture delivers significantly better performance than Flask for ML workloads, reducing response times from 8134ms to 393ms in comparable scenarios.

### Integration Architecture

**API Design**: RESTful endpoints (`/predict/emotion`, `/predict/summary`, `/transcribe/voice`) with WebSocket support for real-time features. **Hybrid approach** using REST for CRUD operations and WebSocket for live emotional analysis.

**Hosting Strategy**: **Kubernetes deployment** with **Docker containerization** provides optimal balance of scalability, cost control, and performance. **AWS SageMaker** or **Google Cloud AI Platform** recommended for enterprise-grade MLOps capabilities.

**Data Pipeline**: **Hybrid real-time/batch processing** architecture using **Apache Kafka** for streaming emotional analysis and **Apache Airflow** for batch pattern detection and training pipelines.

**Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive logging for regulatory compliance, including consent records, data processing activities, and model prediction explanations.

### Performance and Scalability

**Optimization Techniques**: Deploy **model compression** (quantization, pruning, distillation) achieving 2-4x speedup while maintaining 99% accuracy. Use **ONNX Runtime** for cross-platform inference optimization.

**Caching Strategy**: Implement **semantic caching** for similar queries, **prompt caching** for repetitive patterns, and **database result caching** for frequently accessed insights.

**Scalability Architecture**: Design **microservices** with **auto-scaling** capabilities, **load balancing**, and **distributed caching** to handle variable user loads efficiently.

### Security Framework

**API Security**: Implement **OAuth 2.0** with **JWT tokens**, **rate limiting** (token bucket algorithm), and **input validation** against injection attacks.

**Model Protection**: Use **model encryption**, **adversarial robustness testing**, and **query complexity analysis** to prevent model extraction attacks.

**Infrastructure Security**: Deploy **network segmentation**, **secrets management**, and **vulnerability scanning** for secure model deployment.

**Scalability Bottlenecks**: Design **horizontal scaling** architecture, implement **resource monitoring**, and maintain **cost optimization** strategies.

### Operational Risks

**Timeline Delays**: Prepare **scope reduction strategies**, maintain **parallel development streams**, and identify **external vendor options** for critical components.

**Resource Constraints**: Plan **cloud resource scaling**, establish **external development support** options, and consider **open-source alternatives** for non-critical features.
