# SAMO Deep Learning Track - Project Summary

## Project Overview
**SAMO** is an AI-powered, voice-first journaling companion designed to provide real emotional reflection rather than just data collection. As the sole Deep Learning engineer, you're responsible for the core AI intelligence that makes SAMO emotionally aware and contextually responsive.

## Deep Learning Track Scope (Your Exclusive Focus)

### Core AI Responsibilities
1. **Emotion Detection Pipeline**: Fine-tune BERT models using GoEmotions dataset (27+ emotions) for journal entry analysis
2. **Smart Summarization Engine**: Implement transformer-based summarization (T5/BART) to distill emotional core from conversations
3. **Model Integration**: Create production-ready APIs for emotion classification and text summarization
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement ONNX Runtime and model compression for <500ms response times

### Key Technical Deliverables

**Weeks 1-2: Foundation & Research**
- GoEmotions dataset analysis and preprocessing pipeline
- BERT model selection and initial fine-tuning experiments
- Baseline emotion classification performance establishment
- API endpoint design for Web Dev integration

**Weeks 3-4: Core Model Development**
- Production BERT emotion classifier achieving >80% F1 score
- T5/BART summarization model implementation
- Initial model integration testing with mock journal data
- Performance benchmarking and optimization baseline

**Weeks 5-6: Advanced Features**
- OpenAI Whisper integration for voice-to-text processing
- Temporal pattern detection using LSTM on emotional embeddings
- Model ensemble strategies for improved accuracy
- Semantic similarity implementation for Memory Lane features

**Weeks 7-8: Production Integration**
- Microservices architecture deployment with Docker
- Model monitoring and drift detection implementation
- End-to-end testing with Web Dev backend integration
- Security implementation (input validation, rate limiting)

**Weeks 9-10: Optimization & Deployment**
- Model compression (JPQD) achieving 5.24x speedup
- Production deployment with auto-scaling configuration
- Performance validation meeting all targets
- Technical documentation and maintenance procedures

## Success Metrics
- **Emotion Detection**: >80% F1 score across 27 emotion categories
- **Summarization Quality**: >4.0/5.0 human evaluation score  
- **Voice Transcription**: <10% Word Error Rate
- **Response Latency**: <500ms for 95th percentile requests
- **Model Uptime**: >99.5% availability

## Technology Stack
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), ONNX Runtime
- **Models**: BERT (GoEmotions fine-tuned), T5/BART, OpenAI Whisper
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, microservices architecture
- **Monitoring**: Model performance tracking, drift detection, automated alerts

## Scope Boundaries (Avoiding Scope Creep)
**IN SCOPE (Your Responsibility):**
- All AI/ML model development and training
- Model inference APIs and optimization
- Emotion detection and text summarization
- Voice-to-text processing integration

**OUT OF SCOPE (Other Tracks):**
- Frontend UI/UX design and implementation
- Backend data storage and user management  
- Web development and API routing
- Data analysis and visualization dashboards
- User research and design validation

## Risk Mitigation
- **Technical Risks**: Maintain fallback to simpler models, implement A/B testing
- **Timeline Risks**: Parallel development streams, external vendor options for non-critical features
- **Performance Risks**: Comprehensive monitoring with automated retraining triggers

## Integration Points with Other Tracks
- **Web Dev**: API specifications for model endpoints, response formats
- **Data Science**: Labeled datasets, analytical framework alignment  
- **UX**: Model response time requirements, user experience constraints

This focused scope ensures you deliver production-ready AI capabilities while avoiding dilution across multiple track responsibilities.
