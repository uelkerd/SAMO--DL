## üîÑ PR #5: CI/CD Pipeline Overhaul - ACTIVE

### Status: üîÑ **ACTIVE** (Ready to Begin)
**Branch**: `cicd-pipeline-overhaul` (to be created)  
**Priority**: HIGH - Core infrastructure issue

### Core Issues Identified
1. **Inconsistent Conda Command Usage**: Mix of `conda run` and direct conda commands
2. **Shell Script Dependencies**: Shell scripts creating subshell environments
3. **PYTHONPATH Configuration Issues**: PYTHONPATH set in multiple conflicting ways
4. **Complex Environment Setup**: Overly complex conda initialization process

### Implementation Plan
- **Phase 1**: Environment Setup Simplification
- **Phase 2**: Standardized Command Execution
- **Phase 3**: Simplified Job Execution

### Files to Modify
1. `.circleci/config.yml` - Complete conda environment overhaul
2. Remove complex shell script patterns
3. Standardize conda usage with `conda run -n samo-dl-stable`

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All CircleCI jobs pass without conda activation errors
- [ ] No shell script dependencies causing subshell issues
- [ ] Consistent conda binary execution across all steps
- [ ] PYTHONPATH properly configured for module imports
- [ ] Pipeline efficiency optimized

### Next Steps
1. **Create feature branch**: `cicd-pipeline-overhaul`
2. **Begin Phase 2 implementation** (Environment Setup)
3. **Test simplified conda setup locally**
4. **Update CircleCI configuration**
