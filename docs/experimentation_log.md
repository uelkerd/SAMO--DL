- Micro F1: 0.000
- Macro F1: 0.000
- Training Time: 9+ hours (13,493 seconds per epoch)

**Analysis**:
Despite good loss convergence, the F1 scores were zero, indicating a critical issue with the evaluation process. Investigation revealed that the default threshold of 0.5 was too strict for multi-label classification, causing all predictions to be negative. Additionally, the training time was prohibitively long due to the small batch size and large dataset.

**Key Insights**:
1. Multi-label classification requires careful threshold tuning
2. Small batch sizes create excessive computational overhead
3. Need for development mode with subset of data for faster iteration

**Key Insights**:
1. Development mode enables rapid iteration without sacrificing model quality
2. Optimal threshold for multi-label emotion classification is around 0.2
3. Batch size of 128 provides good balance of memory usage and training speed

**Analysis**:
Temperature scaling significantly improved model calibration, with a temperature of 2.0 providing the best F1 score and lowest calibration error. This indicates that the raw model outputs were overconfident and needed scaling to match the true probability distribution.

**Key Insights**:
1. Temperature scaling is effective for calibrating confidence in multi-label classification
2. Optimal temperature of 2.0 suggests model was initially overconfident
3. Calibration improves both F1 score and reliability of confidence scores

- Model Size: 242MB

**Analysis**:
The baseline T5 model showed reasonable performance on summarization tasks but struggled with capturing emotional content and personal reflections in journal entries. The summaries were factual but lacked emotional nuance. Additionally, the model tended to focus on events rather than feelings or insights.

**Key Insights**:
1. T5 provides a solid foundation for abstractive summarization
2. Pre-training on news articles biases the model toward factual summarization
3. Need for fine-tuning on emotion-rich content

### Experiment 2: Emotion-Focused T5 Fine-Tuning (July 14, 2025)

- Emotional Content Accuracy (human evaluation): 72%

**Analysis**:
The emotion-focused fine-tuning significantly improved the model's ability to capture emotional content in summaries. The instruction prefix helped guide the model toward emotional aspects rather than just factual content. Human evaluation confirmed that summaries now better reflected the emotional journey in the original text.

**Key Insights**:
1. Instruction prefixes effectively guide summarization focus
2. Fine-tuning on domain-specific data improves performance significantly
3. Human evaluation is essential for assessing emotional content quality

## 🧠 Key Research Insights

### Multi-label Classification

1. **Threshold Tuning is Critical**: The default threshold of 0.5 is almost always too high for multi-label emotion classification. Values between 0.2-0.3 typically perform best.

2. **Temperature Scaling Improves Calibration**: Raw neural network outputs are often overconfident. Temperature scaling with T>1 effectively calibrates confidence scores.

3. **Class Imbalance Requires Special Handling**: Focal Loss or class weights are essential for balanced performance across common and rare emotions.

4. **Evaluation Metrics Matter**: Micro F1 favors common emotions, while Macro F1 gives equal weight to all classes. Both should be considered.

### Model Optimization

1. **Development Mode Accelerates Research**: Using 5% of data with larger batch sizes provides 16x speedup with similar insights.

2. **Quantization + ONNX Provides Dramatic Speedup**: Combined techniques achieved 3.25x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.

3. **Memory Optimization is Essential for Production**: Careful attention to memory usage patterns prevents OOM errors in production.

4. **Early Stopping Saves Computation**: Most models converge within 2-3 epochs, with diminishing returns afterward.

### Data Quality and Augmentation

1. **Data Quality Trumps Quantity**: Cleaner, well-labeled data outperforms larger but noisier datasets.

2. **Back-translation is Effective for Text Augmentation**: Provides useful linguistic variations while preserving semantic meaning.

3. **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning is Crucial**: Models pre-trained on general text require fine-tuning on domain-specific data.

4. **Ensemble Methods Improve Robustness**: Combining models trained with different objectives provides more reliable predictions.

## 📈 Failed Experiments & Lessons Learned

### 1. RoBERTa for Emotion Classification

**Approach**: Replace BERT with RoBERTa for emotion classification.

**Hypothesis**: RoBERTa's improved pre-training would provide better emotion detection.

**Results**:
- Micro F1: 0.71 (vs. 0.72 for BERT)
- Training Time: 1.4x longer than BERT
- Model Size: 1.2x larger than BERT

**Lesson Learned**: The marginal performance improvement didn't justify the increased computational cost and complexity. BERT provides a better balance of performance and efficiency for our specific task.

### 2. Extreme Quantization (INT4)

**Approach**: Use INT4 quantization instead of INT8 for maximum compression.

**Hypothesis**: INT4 would provide further size reduction with acceptable accuracy loss.

**Results**:
- Size Reduction: 87% (vs. 74.9% for INT8)
- Accuracy Drop: 12% (vs. 1.4% for INT8)
- Inference Time: Similar to INT8

**Lesson Learned**: The accuracy degradation with INT4 was too severe for production use. INT8 represents the optimal balance between model size and accuracy for our application.

### 3. Multi-task Learning (Emotion + Sentiment)

**Approach**: Train a single model to predict both emotions and sentiment.

**Hypothesis**: Shared representations would improve performance on both tasks.

**Results**:
- Emotion F1: 0.68 (vs. 0.72 for single-task)
- Sentiment Accuracy: 0.85 (vs. 0.89 for single-task)
- Training Time: 1.2x longer than single-task

**Lesson Learned**: The tasks, while related, benefit from specialized models. The slight efficiency gain from a unified model didn't compensate for the performance drop.

### 4. Character-level Tokenization

**Approach**: Use character-level tokenization instead of WordPiece.

**Hypothesis**: Character tokenization would handle out-of-vocabulary words better.

**Results**:
- F1 Score: 0.65 (vs. 0.72 for WordPiece)
- Training Time: 1.8x longer
- Inference Time: 1.5x longer

**Lesson Learned**: For emotion classification, word-level semantics are more important than character-level patterns. WordPiece tokenization provides a better balance of vocabulary coverage and efficiency.

### 5. Distilled Models for Speed

**Approach**: Use DistilBERT instead of BERT for faster inference.

**Hypothesis**: Distilled models would provide similar performance with faster inference.

**Results**:
- F1 Score: 0.67 (vs. 0.72 for BERT)
- Model Size: 66% of BERT
- Inference Speed: 1.6x faster than BERT

**Lesson Learned**: While distillation provided speed benefits, the accuracy drop was too significant for our use case. Dynamic quantization of the full BERT model provided better results.
