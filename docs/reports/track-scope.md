# SAMO Deep Learning Track - Project Summary

## Project Overview

**SAMO** is an AI-powered, voice-first journaling companion designed to provide real emotional reflection rather than just data collection. As the sole Deep Learning engineer, you're responsible for the core AI intelligence that makes SAMO emotionally aware and contextually responsive.

## Deep Learning Track Scope 

### Core AI Responsibilities

1. **Emotion Detection Pipeline**: Fine-tune BERT models using GoEmotions dataset (27+ emotions) for journal entry analysis
2. **Smart Summarization Engine**: Implement transformer-based summarization (T5/BART) to distill emotional core from conversations
3. **Model Integration**: Create production-ready APIs for emotion classification and text summarization
4. **Performance Optimization**: Implement ONNX Runtime and model compression for <500ms response times

- **Response Latency**: <500ms for 95th percentile requests
- **Model Uptime**: >99.5% availability

## Technology Stack

- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face), ONNX Runtime
- **Models**: BERT (GoEmotions fine-tuned), T5/BART, OpenAI Whisper
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, microservices architecture
- **Monitoring**: Model performance tracking, drift detection, automated alerts

## Scope Boundaries (Avoiding Scope Creep)

**IN SCOPE (DL Responsibility):**

- All AI/ML model development and training
- Model inference APIs and optimization
- Emotion detection and text summarization
- Voice-to-text processing integration

**OUT OF SCOPE (Other Tracks):**

- Frontend UI/UX design and implementation
- Backend data storage and user management
- Web development and API routing
- Data analysis and visualization dashboards
- User research and design validation

## Risk Mitigation

- **Technical Risks**: Maintain fallback to simpler models, implement A/B testing
- **Timeline Risks**: Parallel development streams, external vendor options for non-critical features
- **Performance Risks**: Comprehensive monitoring with automated retraining triggers

## Integration Points with Other Tracks

- **Web Dev**: API specifications for model endpoints, response formats
- **Data Science**: Labeled datasets, analytical framework alignment
- **UX**: Model response time requirements, user experience constraints

## Collaboration Model: DL vs. Data Science

To ensure clarity and prevent redundant work, the collaboration between the Deep Learning and Data Science tracks follows a clear, cyclical pattern:

1.  **Data Analysis (Data Science)**: The Data Science track analyzes potential datasets (e.g., user-generated content, new public datasets) to identify statistical properties, biases, and overall suitability. They provide these analytical reports to the DL track.

2.  **Model Training (Deep Learning)**: The Deep Learning track uses the analytical insights to build, train, and optimize AI models. This is the core responsibility of the DL engineer, encompassing all activities in the *Model Training Playbook*.

3.  **Prediction & Performance APIs (Deep Learning)**: The DL track exposes the trained models via secure, performant APIs that produce predictions and performance metrics.

4.  **Insight Generation (Data Science)**: The Data Science track consumes the API outputs to perform aggregate analysis, monitor for model drift, generate business intelligence dashboards, and identify patterns in model performance or user emotional trends.

This process creates a powerful feedback loop where Data Science insights directly inform the next iteration of Deep Learning model development, without overlapping the core responsibilities of model training.

This focused scope ensures you deliver production-ready AI capabilities while avoiding dilution across multiple track responsibilities.
