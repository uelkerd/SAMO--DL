# ðŸ”„ CI Pipeline Trigger

This file was created to trigger a new CI pipeline run to test our fixes.

## Fixes Applied

1. **BERT Classifier Device Attribute**: Added `self.device` initialization
2. **Test Mocking**: Fixed BERT forward method mocking in tests
3. **Predict Emotions Bug**: Fixed `torch.sigmoid()` applied to dictionary instead of tensor

## Expected Results

- âœ… All unit tests should pass
- âœ… No more TypeError in dropout layers
- âœ… No more AttributeError for device
- âœ… Proper emotion prediction functionality

## Next Steps

After CI passes:
1. Monitor pipeline status
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Check code coverage improvements
4. Proceed with performance optimization
