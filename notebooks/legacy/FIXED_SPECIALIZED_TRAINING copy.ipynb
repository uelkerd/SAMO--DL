        "*   The initial attempt to implement class weighting faced issues due to undefined variables and missing imports, which were resolved by recreating necessary data and ensuring all dependencies were imported.\n",
        "*   A `SyntaxError` in the manually created balanced dataset was identified and corrected.\n",
        "*   The custom `WeightedLossTrainer` initially failed due to an incorrect method signature for `compute_loss`; this was fixed by adding the `num_items_in_batch` parameter and ensuring class weights were on the correct device.\n",
        "*   After resolving these issues, the model was successfully trained using the `WeightedLossTrainer` with calculated class weights.\n",
        "*   Evaluation of the model trained with class weights on the validation set yielded the following metrics: F1 Score: 0.396, Accuracy: 0.483, Precision: 0.405, and Recall: 0.483.\n",
        "*   `UndefinedMetricWarning` messages were observed during evaluation, indicating that the model did not predict any samples for certain emotion classes in the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The observed `UndefinedMetricWarning` suggests that even with class weighting, the model may still struggle to correctly classify all emotion categories, particularly those that might still be under-represented or have subtle distinctions in the data. Further analysis into the specific classes causing the warnings is needed.\n",
        "*   Consider exploring data augmentation techniques for the under-represented classes in conjunction with or as an alternative to class weighting to provide more diverse training examples and potentially improve performance on these classes.\n"
