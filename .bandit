# Bandit security linter configuration for SAMO-DL project
# This file configures bandit to ignore false positives and focus on real security issues

[bandit]
# Keep B104 enabled; use inline `# nosec B104` on intentional 0.0.0.0 bindings.
# This ensures we catch real security issues while allowing intentional production bindings.

# B104: Binding to all interfaces - Use inline # nosec B104 only where 0.0.0.0 is strictly required
# (e.g., Cloud Run entrypoint) with proper justification in code comments.

# Include specific files and directories
include = src/, scripts/, deployment/

# Exclude test files and build artifacts
exclude = tests/, build/, __pycache__/, .git/, .pytest_cache/
