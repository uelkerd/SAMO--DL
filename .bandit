# Bandit security linter configuration for SAMO-DL project
# This file configures bandit to ignore false positives and focus on real security issues

[bandit]
# Skip specific tests that generate false positives for this project
skips = B104

# B104: Binding to all interfaces - This is a false positive because:
# 1. The application only binds to 0.0.0.0 in production environments (Cloud Run, Docker)
# 2. This is required for containerized deployments to work properly
# 3. In development, it defaults to 127.0.0.1 for security
# 4. The production environment is properly secured with Cloud Run's network isolation

# Other tests to potentially skip in the future:
# B101: Test for use of assert_used - May be needed for testing
# B601: Test for shell injection - May be needed for legitimate subprocess calls

# Include specific files and directories
include = src/, scripts/, deployment/

# Exclude test files and build artifacts
exclude = tests/, build/, __pycache__/, .git/, .pytest_cache/
