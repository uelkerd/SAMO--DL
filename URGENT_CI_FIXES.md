# ðŸš¨ URGENT CI FIXES NEEDED

## Status: CRITICAL - Tests Still Failing

The unit tests are still failing with the same errors because our fixes haven't been committed to the remote repository.

## âœ… Fixes Applied Locally (But NOT Committed):

### 1. Device Attribute Fix âœ…
**File**: `src/models/emotion_detection/bert_classifier.py`
**Fix**: Added `self.device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")` to `__init__`

### 2. Test Mocking Fix âœ…
**File**: `tests/unit/test_emotion_detection.py`
**Fix**: Simplified BERT mocking and added `model.eval()` to disable dropout

### 3. Predict Emotions Bug âœ…
**File**: `src/models/emotion_detection/bert_classifier.py`
**Fix**: Already fixed - using `outputs["probabilities"]` instead of `torch.sigmoid(outputs)`

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NEXT STEP:

**WE MUST COMMIT AND PUSH THESE CHANGES TO MAKE THEM EFFECTIVE!**

The terminal is having issues, so we need to manually:
1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "Fix critical CI test failures: device attribute and test mocking"`
3. `git push`

## Expected Results After Push:
- âœ… No more AttributeError for device
- âœ… No more TypeError in dropout layers
- âœ… All unit tests should pass
- âœ… CI pipeline should be green

## Pipeline URLs:
- Latest Failed: #42
- Currently Running: #43 (will fail with old code)
- Next Run: #44 (should pass with our fixes)
